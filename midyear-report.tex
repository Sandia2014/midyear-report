%%% Note that for your Clinic report, you should remove any        %%%
%%% comments that aren't relevant to your report.  You should also %%%
%%% remove the copyright notice assigning copyright to the         %%%

%%% Preamble.

%%% The top part of your document is called the preamble.  You supply
%%% some basic information about the document (such as its title and
%%% author) in a form that LaTeX can understand here.


%%% The first active line in your LaTeX document is the \documentclass
%%% command, which loads a LaTeX class file.  Class files generally
%%% define the appearance of a document, and include a variety of
%%% structural commands.

%%% Clinic reports use the clinic class, which should be located
%%% somewhere in TeX's search path.

%%% For midyear reports, include the midyear option, as in
%%%   \documentclass[midyear]{hmcclinic}
\documentclass{hmcclinic}

%%% You can also load additional LaTeX packages, or style files, that
%%% affect the way that the document is laid out, typeset, or supply
%%% additional commands or environments.  If you choose to load
%%% additional packages, make sure that they appear *before* the
%%% line loading hyperref; hyperref changes pieces of other
%%% packages, so it's important that it be loaded last.

% \usepackage{graphicx}           % More control over graphic inclusion.
% \usepackage{amsthm}             % AMS theorem styles


%%% Load all other packages before this point.

%%% Load hyperref.
\usepackage[breaklinks=true,
  bookmarks,
  pdfpagemode=UseOutlines,
  pdfpagelayout=SinglePage]{hyperref}


%%% The preamble can also be used to define your own commands and
%%% environments, set some constants that will be used throughout your
%%% document, and so on.

%%% As you may have guessed, LaTeX's comment character is the percent
%%% sign.  Any line that starts with a % will be ignored.  You can
%%% also use the comment character to add comments to the end of a
%%% line that will be parsed by TeX.

%%% The optional \includeonly command allows you to specify the names
%%% of chapters that you want to typeset.  It is useful for debugging
%%% or for working intensely on one particular part of your document
%%% when you don't want to take the time to retypeset the entire document.


%%% This optional command provides additional context around an error.
%%% It can be helpful when tracking down a problem. 
%\setcounter{errorcontextlines}{1000}


%%% Information about this document.

%%% I find it most useful to put identifying information about a
%%% document near the top of the preamble.  Technically, this
%%% information must precede the \maketitle command, which often
%%% appears immediately after the beginning of the document 
%%% environment.  Placing it near the top of the document makes it
%%% easier to identify the document, and keeps it from getting
%%% mixed up with the content of your document.

%%% So, some questions.

%% What is the name of the company or organization sponsoring your project?
\sponsor{Sandia National Laboratories}

%% What is the title of your report?
\title{Midyear Update}

%% Who are the authors of the report (your team members)?  (Separate
%% names with \and.)
\author{Alex Gruver \and Ellen Hui \and Tyler Marklyn \and Brett Collins~(Project Manager)}

%% What is your faculty advisor's name?  (Again, separate names with
%% \and, if necessary.)
\advisor{Jeff Amelang}

%% Liaison's name or names?
\liaison{Carter Edwards}

%% By not specifying a date with the \date command, the date the
%% document is typeset will be added.

%% If you need to put in a specific date, do so with
%%  \date{May 13, 2004}
%% You probably shouldn't, however.

%%% End of information section.


%%% New commands and environments.

%%% You can define your own commands and environments here.  If you
%%% have a lot of material here, you might want to consider splitting
%%% the commands and environments into a separate ``style'' file that
%%% you load with \usepackage.

% \newcommand{\coolcommand}[1]{#1 is cool.} % Lets everyone know that
                                % the person or thing that you provide
                                % as the argument to the command is
                                % cool.

% \newcounter{cms}


%%% Some theorem-like command definitions.

%%% The \newtheorem command comes from the amsthm package.  That
%%% package is *not* loaded by the class file, so if you choose
%%% to use these commands, you'll need to load the package above.

% \newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[chapter]
% \newtheorem{lem}{Lemma}[chapter]


%%% If you find that some words in your document are being hyphenated
%%% incorrectly, you can specify the correct hyphenation using the
%%% \hyphenation command.  Note that words are separated by
%%% whitespace, as shown below.

\hyphenation{ap-pen-dix wer-ther-i-an}


%%% The start of the document!

%% The document environment is the main environment in any LaTeX
%% document.  It contains other environments, as well as your text.

\begin{document}

%%% The front matter of a large document includes the title page or
%%% pages, tables of contents, lists of figures or tables, and so on,
%%% your abstract, a preface or introduction, and so on.  It's
%%% delineated with the \frontmatter command.



%%% One of the things that the \frontmatter does is make page
%%% numbers appear as lowercase Roman numerals---i, vi, xii, and so
%%% on.

%%% The first thing in the front matter is your title page.  The title
%%% page is formatted by commands in the document class file, so you
%%% don't need to worry about what it looks like -- just putting the
%%% \maketitle command in your document (and filling in the necessary
%%% information for the identification commands above) is enough.

\maketitle

\mainmatter


%%% Content.

% FIXME: all section headers are placeholders, we should put something more
% official in their place.

\section*{What went well}
% Alex's section

\section*{What didn't go well}
% Ellen's section
Our initial plan for this semester called for a fully re-engineered Intrepid
package using Kokkos by early December, which we would present in a seminar
during our site visit to Sandia at the end of the semester.  However, we have
run into a few setbacks, and are therefore unlikely to meet that goal.

Originally, we had hoped to find a working algorithm using Kokkos that yielded
speedup comparable to hand-coded Cuda and OpenMP for Intrepid tensor
contractions.  However, our prototype Kokkos implementations have lagged in
speed performance, even when taking into account coalescence and memory layout.
We have since abandoned Kokkos multidimensional Views for the moment, instead
using single-dimension Kokkos views in order to have finer control over the
memory layout.  While this approach is yielding promising results with Kokkos
OpenMP, both the Kokkos Cuda and manual Cuda implementations have been
disappointingly slow.

We are continuing to work on getting speedup from Kokkos and manual Cuda, but
we feel it would be counterproductive to work on more Intrepid kernels until we
have our single prototype kernel producing performance gains on the expected
order of magnitude.  Therefore, given the amount of time left in the semester,
it is likely that we will have to settle for presenting our prototype kernel
instead of a fully reworked Intrepid package in December.
